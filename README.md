# Landsat7
Position estimation of the Landsat7 satellite through an Extended Kalman filter
The satellite data are taken from the Google Earth Engine Platform and represent the position of the center of the images taken by the satellite on May 5, 2015.
The Python program takes the images in the file and uses a Kalman Filter to estimate the satellite's position.
Three graphs are then shown: the first represents the estimated and accurate trajectory in the orbital plane, the second the measurement errors, and the third the trajectory on a flat map of the Earth.
